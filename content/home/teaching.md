# List of internships (Geoinformatics/Remote Sensing)

I maintain a list of internships undertaken in the Geoinformatics or Remote Sensing field by B.Sc. Geography & M.Sc. Geoinformatics students.  
There will be no online version of this document due to possibly sensible contact data.
If you want to add your intership to the list, please contact me.
