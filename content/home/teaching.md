# List of internships (Geoinformatics/Remote Sensing)

I maintain a list of internships done in the Geoinformatics/Remote Sensing field by FSU students (B.Sc. Geography & M.Sc. Geoinformatics).  
Please come to my office or write me an e-mail if you want to get it. We cannot make it available for the public due to sensible contact data.
If you have undertaken an Geoinf/RS related internship in your B.Sc./M.Sc., please contact me so I can add yours to the list.
