# About me

I am a **PhD student** at the **GIScience group** of the Friedrich-Schiller-University in Jena. I focus on the application of statistical- and machine learning techniques to address research questions related to environmental issues. Beside the scientific part I am also interested in the development of (geo)statistical programming solutions to simplify todays data science challenges. Check the [project section] section for detailed information.
