# List of internships (Geoinformatics/Remote Sensing)

I maintain a list of internships undertaken in the Geoinformatics or Remote Sensing field by B.Sc. Geography & M.Sc. Geoinformatics students.  
Please come to my office if you are interested. We will not share it in a digital way due to sensible contact data.
If you want to add your intership to the list, feel free to contact me.
