# About me

I am a **PhD student** within the [GIScience group](http://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Geoinformatik_p_1558.html) at the [Department of Geography](http://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Institut+f√ºr+Geographie.html). 
I focus on the application of statistical- and machine learning techniques to address research questions related to environmental issues. 
Beside the scientific part I am also interested in the development of (geo)statistical programming solutions to simplify todays data science challenges. 
Check the [**projects**]({{< relref "#projects" >}}) section for detailed information.
I like to [**write**]({{< relref "#blog" >}}) about the Linux world, R stuff and other technical topics that I find interesting.
You can find my CV {{% staticref "pdf/cv.pdf" %}}**here**{{% /staticref %}}.
